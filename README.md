# Behavioral Imaging Toolbox
Bitbox is a free and open-source Python library including a comprehensive set of tools for the computational analysis of nonverbal human behavior. The provided tools enable analysis of face, head, and body movements, expressions, and actions from videos and images. Included algorithms and metrics have been validated using clinically vetted datasets and published extensively, therefore, can be reliably used by behavioral, social, and medical scientists in their human subject research. As we closely follow state-of-the-art in computer vision and machine learning, provided methodologies can also be relied upon by computer vision researchers and other engineers as well.
